# Image Formats
## JPG / JPEG ##
+ JPEG is an initialism/acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group.
+ Every time you save a JPG, it gets **compressed**. 
    + ℹ️ Compression is a way of removing data so that the resulting file size is smaller.
    + ⚙️ In Photoshop, we can actually control the amount of compression that the export process uses. 
+ JPGs are great for most photos; however, they will **always be rendered as a rectangle**.
+ They also **do not support transparency or animation**.

## PNG ##
+ Portable Network Graphics (PNGs) have less compression than JPGs.
    + 💾 This means that they can be higher quality, but also **larger file sizes**.
+ PNGs can also have **transparency**. This comes in handy for things like icons, avatars, or something that you might want to render as an ellipse. 

## GIF ##
+ The Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) is one of the most ubiquitous formats on the web.
+ This file format supports multiple frames — that is to say, it **supports animation**.
    + 🔁 Animated GIFs can be played once, or on a loop.
+ However, it only supports 8-bit images (i.e. a palette of **256 or fewer colours**). 
+ It also allows for one transparent colour. This is great for things like logos, text, or simple cartoons.

## Which to pick?
> 💡 Generally: we want the **best** looking image at the **smallest** size.
